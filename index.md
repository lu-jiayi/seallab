Welcome to the SEAL Lab! We examine how syntactic information is represented, acquired, and processed by human speakers, using a combination of formal analysis, and experimental, computational, and corpus-based methods. 

We are the youngest research group at Northwestern Linguistics! If you are interested in syntax, psycholinguistics, or any adjacent field of study, we are excited to welcome you onboard!

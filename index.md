# The <span style="color:blue">S</span>yntax and <span style="color:blue">E</span>xperiment<span style="color:blue">a</span>l <span style="color:blue">L</span>inguistics Lab

Welcome to the SEAL Lab! We are the newest research group at Northwestern Linguistics! We examine how syntactic information is represented, acquired, and processed by human speakers, using a combination of formal analysis, and experimental, computational, and corpus-based methods. 

If you are interested in syntax, psycholinguistics, or any adjacent field of study, we are excited to welcome you onboard!
